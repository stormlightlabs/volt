/**
 * Entry point for VoltX.js development demo
 *
 * This file initializes the comprehensive demo showcasing:
 * - VoltX.js declarative reactivity (charge, data-volt-state, data-volt-computed)
 * - Volt CSS classless styling (typography, layout, Tufte sidenotes)
 * - Plugin system (persist, scroll, url, surge, shift)
 *
 * The demo is built programmatically but uses declarative VoltX attributes, demonstrating how to create apps with minimal JavaScript.
